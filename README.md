Who is the most important character in the book series?

3 methods (importance measures) used to answer this question:

1) **degree centrality** (number of neighbors of a node in the network)
2) **betweenness centrality** (node which holds the network together)
3) **degree centrality** (evaluates the inlinks and outlinks of nodes in the character network in the book)
